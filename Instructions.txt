The program deals with two kinds of scenarios. The first one handles a sentence as the input for the program 
In the second scenario the program reads information from a text file and performs the same steps. The only difference is 
that in the second case we iterate through all the lines of the file i.e, we are repeating the first case several times. 

To execute the program from and IDE just run it as a java application. 
In order to use the file option, drop the attached file (authorFileToBeRead.txt) in a directory of your choice and then change 
the INPUT_FILE field in the AuthorTest.java file to point to the previously chosen directory.
