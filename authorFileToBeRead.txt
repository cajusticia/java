On a bleak Scottish moorland, Macbeth and Banquo, two of King Duncan's generals, discover three strange women (witches). 
They prophesy that Macbeth will be promoted, eventually becoming King of Scotland, while Banquo's descendants shall be kings 
(Banquo is not promised any kingdom himself, which isn't much fun for Banquo). The generals want to hear more, but the" weird sisters" 
disappear. Afterwards, King Duncan names Macbeth Thane of Cawdor (a rank of the aristocracy bestowed by grateful kings) in thanks for 
his success in the recent battles, which seems to support the prophecy. He then proposes to make a brief visit that night to Macbeth's 
castle at Inverness.
